# Assignment 3 - kNN Classification

**Task 1 [70 points]**: Use the Scikit-learn implementation of kNN and evaluate its prediction accuracy on the Connect-4 dataset. Note that the Euclidean distance may not be the best distance metric to use for this dataset. Since the features are categorical, [Hamming Distance](https://datagy.io/python-hamming-distance/) be a more appropriate distance metric to use. Follow the detailed instructions given in the Jupyter Notebook to complete the task.

**Task 2 [30 points]**: Use a 60/20/20 train/validation/test split to tune the hyperparameter k of the kNN algorithm to get the best possible accuracy. Report the best accuracy that you could achieve on the test set and how much time it takes to classify a single instance of the test set and the full test set.  Follow the detailed instructions given in the Jupyter Notebook to complete the task.

**What to submit**: The assignment will be submitted directly to Github. After you have cloned the repository and completed the tasks, you will need to push your changes back to the main repository.

**Note**: Make sure the Jupyter notebook you submit shows the outputs of running each cell after adding your code.
